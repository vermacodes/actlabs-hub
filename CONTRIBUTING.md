# Contributing to the ACTLabs Server

The ACTLabs project is always open for potential contributions. Although some contributions require prerequisite knowledge of software development, there's more than just code.

## Documentation

All documentation for ACTLabs is located inside the AzureContainers internal wiki: <https://aka.ms/actlabs-docs>. There's always documentation to write, update, and improve. If you're interested in contributing to the documentation, please reach follow the [SUPPORT](./SUPPORT.md) guide to reach out to the ACTLabs team and discuss further.

### How do I contribute to the documentation?

Because the ACTLabs documentation is in the AzureContaienrs wiki, the contribution process doesn't change from the regular wiki contributions. You can open new work items for documentation updates using the work item template at <https://aka.ms/actwiki/wikiworkitem> and use the contributor guide at <https://aka.ms/actwiki/wikiauthor> to learn how to contribute to the wiki.

Once your updates are completed, the pull request opened in Azure Dev Ops will be the primary review mechanism for the ACTLabs team to review and approve the changes.

## Feature Requests

The primary goal of ACTLabs is to offer a tool that makes building lab environments for troubleshooting and training as seamless as possible. If there's something missing that you'd like to see or something that's preventing you from adopting ACTLabs as a regular tool in your day-to-day, please open an issue on the GitHub repository with a `feature request` label and we'll triage it and discuss it further.

## Bug Reports

We're not perfect - if you find a bug or have concerns about how something is working in the application today, please use the [SUPPORT](./SUPPORT.md) guide for more information on how to report it.

## Code Contributions

If you're interested in contributing to the code and fixing bugs or adding new functionality, please reference the more in-depth [developer onboarding guide](./docs/developer-onboarding.md). This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, running the tests, and submitting a pull request.
